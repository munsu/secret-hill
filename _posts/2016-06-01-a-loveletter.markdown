## *She lives the poetry she cannot write*

I've always liked this caption in your [blog][secret-hill-tumblr]. I've played with the idea that whenever you're not writing, you're caught in a grand poem. With the year that has passed, I like to think I'm part of this poem. It's silly but this brings me great happiness. Of course, I didn't make this site for you to not write on it ðŸ™„. I made this site as a love letter, to show my appreciation and gratitude for the past two years, and as a gift, because it's not *really* a love letter.

## About the love letter

## About the gift

## Happy number 2 ðŸ’©
