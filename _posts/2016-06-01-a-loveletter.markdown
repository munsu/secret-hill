## *She lives the poetry she cannot write*

I've always liked this caption in your [blog][secret-hill-tumblr]. I've played with the idea that whenever you're not writing, you're caught in some grand poem. With the year that has passed, I like to think I'm part of this poem. It's silly but this brings me great happiness. Of course, I didn't make this site for you to not write on it 🙄. I made this site as a love letter, to show my appreciation and gratitude for the past two years, and as a gift, because it's not *really* a love letter. I hope you like it.


## *About the love letter*

The past year has been somewhat easier than the last. With the last, we worked through our many *many* differences. Through the differences, we've found ourselves still with each other. With each other, we've had adventures and happiness. With happiness, we got through the past year.

You've been patient, kind, loving, understanding, and a bunch more with me. When I get mad on the road, you get scared but also try to soothe me. 😂 When I ask something of you, you do it even if a bit begrudgingly. :p When I go full butt, you've been understanding. With everything, you've went all out in loving me. And I, you. ❤ It is an *unbelievable* thing, what we have. And I'm looking forward to where it'll lead us. From the plans that we have and the dreams that we share, I'm happy it's with you <3.

I've been trying to write. Though I feel, I've found myself living a poem too grand, a bit overwhelming to write. Kidding, I'll share those soon. :p



## *About the gift*

I learned about this sorta site a while ago and thought it a nice way to get into writing. You get much finer control over everything because you have to actually write some code. Yes, you'll write code. Hahahaha. No worries, I'll help. :)

You'll learn a bit about programming and maybe understand a bit about my line of work. My ulterior motive, of course, is to get you to ask me questions on how to do stuff on this site. In a way, it's a gift for myself as well. :p

I can't wait to see what you'll do with this site. 🙈


## *Happy number 2* 💩

I like how I'm *just* finding out that we actually have some common ground (e.g., this site with my programming and your writing, and longboard dancing, which we've yet to learn 😅). We just haven't found most of them yet. I'm *excited*.

As per tradition, for you:

    Roses are red,
    Violets are blue;
    I just want to say,
    Thank you for #2.
