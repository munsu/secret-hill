    <description>She lives the poetry she cannot write. Crazy for turtles, sushi and the spontaneity of life.

        <title>A love letter</title>
        <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;she-lives-the-poetry-she-cannot-write&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;She lives the poetry she cannot write&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve always liked this caption in your &lt;a href=&quot;http://secret-hill.tumblr.com&quot;&gt;blog&lt;/a&gt;. I’ve played with the idea that whenever you’re not writing, you’re caught in some grand poem. With the year that has passed, I like to think I’m part of this poem. It’s silly but this brings me great happiness. Of course, I didn’t make this site for you to not write on it 🙄. I made this site as a love letter, to show my appreciation and gratitude for the past two years, and as a gift, because it’s not &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; a love letter. I hope you like it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-love-letter&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;About the love letter&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The past year has been somewhat easier than the last. With the last, we worked through our many &lt;em&gt;many&lt;/em&gt; differences. Through the differences, we’ve found ourselves still with each other. With each other, we’ve had adventures and happiness. With happiness, we got through the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ve been patient, kind, loving, understanding, and a bunch more with me. When I get mad on the road, you get scared but also try to soothe me. 😂 When I ask something of you, you do it even if a bit begrudgingly. :p When I go full butt, you’ve been understanding. With everything, you’ve went all out in loving me. And I, you. ❤ It is an &lt;em&gt;unbelievable&lt;/em&gt; thing, what we have. And I’m looking forward to where it’ll lead us. From the plans that we have and the dreams that we share, I’m happy it’s with you &amp;lt;3.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve been trying to write. Though I feel, I’ve found myself living a poem too grand, a bit overwhelming to write. Kidding, I’ll share those soon. :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;about-the-gift&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;About the gift&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned about this sorta site a while ago and thought it a nice way to get into writing. You get much finer control over everything because you have to actually write some code. Yes, you’ll write code. Hahahaha. No worries, I’ll help. :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You’ll learn a bit about programming and maybe understand a bit about my line of work. My ulterior motive, of course, is to get you to ask me questions on how to do stuff on this site. In a way, it’s a gift for myself as well. :p&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I can’t wait to see what you’ll do with this site. 🙈&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;happy-number-2-&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Happy number 2&lt;/em&gt; 💩&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I like how I’m &lt;em&gt;just&lt;/em&gt; finding out that we actually have some common ground (e.g., this site with my programming and your writing, and longboard dancing, which we’ve yet to learn 😅). We just haven’t found most of them yet. I’m &lt;em&gt;excited&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As per tradition, for you:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;highlighter-rouge&quot;&gt;&lt;pre class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Roses are red,
Violets are blue;
I just want to say,
Thank you for #2.
&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;div class=&quot;box alt&quot;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&quot;row 50% uniform&quot;&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;3u&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
        &lt;div class=&quot;6u$&quot;&gt;
            &lt;span class=&quot;image fit&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/loveletter-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Butts&quot; /&gt;&lt;/span&gt;
        &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;
