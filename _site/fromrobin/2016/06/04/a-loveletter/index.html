<p>I’ve always liked this caption in your <a href="http://secret-hill.tumblr.com">blog</a>. I’ve played with the idea that whenever you’re not writing, you’re caught in some grand poem. With the year that has passed, I like to think I’m part of this poem. It’s silly but this brings me great happiness. Of course, I didn’t make this site for you to not write on it 🙄. I made this site as a love letter, to show my appreciation and gratitude for the past two years, and as a gift, because it’s not <em>really</em> a love letter. I hope you like it.</p>

<h2 id="about-the-love-letter"><em>About the love letter</em></h2>

<p>The past year has been somewhat easier than the last. With the last, we worked through our many <em>many</em> differences. Through the differences, we’ve found ourselves still with each other. With each other, we’ve had adventures and happiness. With happiness, we got through the past year.</p>

<p>You’ve been patient, kind, loving, understanding, and a bunch more with me. When I get mad on the road, you get scared but also try to soothe me. 😂 When I ask something of you, you do it even if a bit begrudgingly. :p When I go full butt, you’ve been understanding. With everything, you’ve went all out in loving me. And I, you. ❤ It is an <em>unbelievable</em> thing, what we have. And I’m looking forward to where it’ll lead us. From the plans that we have and the dreams that we share, I’m happy it’s with you &lt;3.</p>

<p>I’ve been trying to write. Though I feel, I’ve found myself living a poem too grand, a bit overwhelming to write. Kidding, I’ll share those soon. :p</p>

<h2 id="about-the-gift"><em>About the gift</em></h2>

<p>I learned about this sorta site a while ago and thought it a nice way to get into writing. You get much finer control over everything because you have to actually write some code. Yes, you’ll write code. Hahahaha. No worries, I’ll help. :)</p>

<p>You’ll learn a bit about programming and maybe understand a bit about my line of work. My ulterior motive, of course, is to get you to ask me questions on how to do stuff on this site. In a way, it’s a gift for myself as well. :p</p>

<p>I can’t wait to see what you’ll do with this site. 🙈</p>

<h2 id="happy-number-2-"><em>Happy number 2</em> 💩</h2>

<p>I like how I’m <em>just</em> finding out that we actually have some common ground (e.g., this site with my programming and your writing, and longboard dancing, which we’ve yet to learn 😅). We just haven’t found most of them yet. I’m <em>excited</em>.</p>

<p>As per tradition, for you:</p>
